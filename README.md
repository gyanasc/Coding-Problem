Solved some best coding problem with best solution

Coding questions:

1.       Difference between ‘this’ and ‘let’ and when to use what, explain with examples.

2.       Write a function which accepts an array of strings and returns a map of character to count of the character(including spaces and special characters).

Eg: input: [‘hello world’, ‘hello world’]  output: {h: 2, e: 2, l: 6, ‘ ‘: 1, o: 4 …… }

3.       Write a function to return all the keys present in an object at any level.

Eg: input: {  a: 5, b: { c: { d: 10 } }}   output: [a, b, c, d]

4.       Write a function to reverse every word of a string.

·         Using split and reverse

·         Without using split and reverse and in O(1) space (since strings are immutable, assume that the input is a character array).

5.       Write a function to remove duplicate strings from an array of strings.

        QUESTION 1.Difference between ‘this’ and ‘let’ and when to use what, explain with examples.

        The this keyword refers to the current instance of the class 
        and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method.

        The Let keyword allows you to create a range variable and initialized with the result of the query expression 
        and then you are allowed to use that variable with the upcoming clause in the same query. 
        When you initialize a range variable with one value after that 
        you are not allowed to store another value in the range variable.
